# Patient-satisfaction-in-Macedonia
The data was collected with the aid of an online questionnaires. Our goal is to extract information from our 
dataset in order to gain information about the patients' experiences and their satisfaction in the health care 
services, more specifically the health care delivery system in the Republic of Macedonia.
We study the relationship between each service and itâ€™s satisfaction rating to conclude the overall 
satisfaction rate with the hospital services. 
We think that it is very important for the hospital to know the services that are valued by patients and the 
reasons behind patient satisfaction or dissatisfaction in order to improve health care services and delivery 
systems in Macedonia hospitals. Also, other health care providers can benefit from this by knowing which 
services affect the patient satisfaction and which areas in their services should they focus on.
